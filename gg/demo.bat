    echo - No cycles allowed. It's not your friend group drama.
    echo - Used to represent commit history where each commit can have multiple parents
    echo - Perfect for representing non-linear history with branches and merges
    echo - Fast traversal with skip lists
    echo - Beautiful, chaotic, and surprisingly efficient

    echo - Efficient prefix-based lookup for file paths
